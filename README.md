## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**gporawetku/gporawetku** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a Transportation Management System using Next.js, along with other ongoing projects involving React, TypeScript, and more.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about Redis, PostgreSQL, and Firebase to enhance my backend development skills.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on innovative web development projects that involve modern technologies like Node.js, Express, and Next.js.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with optimizing performance in large-scale React applications and improving deployment processes using tools like Jenkins and PM2.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about full stack development, particularly with Next.js, and creating RESTful APIs.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him (à¹€à¸‚à¸²)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love discussing and exchanging knowledge about new technologies and work methodologies, and I believe that my growth must make the team stronger.
